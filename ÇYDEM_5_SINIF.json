One pupil closes their eyes and picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or a season on it (e.g., a sun for sunny, snowflakes for winter). They put the hat on without seeing the picture.Their peer looks at the hat and uses only facial expressions, gestures, or mimics to help the other pupil guess the correct word from the list written on the board. To make it easier, the teacher writes all possible words (e.g., sunny, rainy, winter, spring) on the board beforehand. For example, if the hat shows “windy”, the peer might puff their cheeks and pretend to blow air. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by selecting the word from the board. If they guess correctly, the pair earns a point. The game continues with pairs taking turns.The teacher provides positive feedback to encourage them.

The answer cards are placed face-up on the table, while the question cards are kept in a box face-down. Each group takes turns being the reader. The reader draws a question card, reads it aloud, and the other groups collaborate to quickly find and slap the correct answer card on the table.Questions:* What do you do at school in the morning?* What is your favourite school activity?* What are you doing at school now?Answers:* We have a school assembly every morning.* My favourite school activity is the drama performance.* We are having lunch now.Each correct match earns a point for the group. The game continues until all questions are matched. The group with the most points wins, encouraging teamwork and helping pupils improve their understanding of school-themed vocabulary and sentence structures. The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them.

Pupils play this game using image cards placed face-up on the table and word cards read aloud. In each round, one pupil acts as the “reader” and picks a word card to read aloud. Other pupils quickly identify and tap the correct image card. The first pupil to tap the correct card earns a point, while tapping the wrong card means losing their turn for that round. At the end of the game, the pupil or group with the most points wins. This activity support  vocabulary building and visual memory in a fun and engaging way. The teacher provides positive feedback to encourage them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticonsTHEME 2ExpansionObjective: To describe seasons and weather conditions in English by using the target vocabulary and target chunks.Activity 1: Hat Guessing GamePupils work in pairs. One pupil closes their eyes and randomly picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or season on it (e.g., a sunny day, winter snow). The pupil puts the hat on without looking at the picture. Their peer looks at the hat and gives clues by saying sentences such as, “It’s cold”, or “It’s cloudy”. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by asking questions such as, “Is it snowy?” or “Is it summer?”. Each correct guess earns the pair a point. The game continues with pairs taking turns, and the pair with the most points wins. Thisactivity practices vocabulary in a fun and interactive way while encouraging speaking and listening skills.The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To describe seasons and weather conditions in English by using the target vocabulary.Activity 1: Hat Guessing Game with MimicsPupils work in pairs. One pupil closes their eyes and picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or a season on it (e.g., a sun for sunny, snowflakes for winter). They put the hat on without seeing the picture.Their peer looks at the hat and uses only facial expressions, gestures, or mimics to help the other pupil guess the correct word from the list written on the board. To make it easier, the teacher writes all possible words (e.g., sunny, rainy, winter, spring) on the board beforehand. For example, if the hat shows “windy”, the peer might puff their cheeks and pretend to blow air. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by selecting the word from the board. If they guess correctly, the pair earns a point. The game continues with pairs taking turns.The teacher provides positive feedback to encourage them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.THEME 3ExpansionObjective: To describe and talk about clothing and clothing preferences in English by using the target vocabulary and target chunks.Activity 1: Design the CharacterEach pupil is given a paragraph describing a character’s physical appearance, clothing, and personality traits. For example: “The character has wavy hair and blue eyes. She/He is wearing a raincoat, leggings, and slippers. She/He is very kind and enjoys quiet activities”. Pupils use the description to design the character on a blank person template. They cut out pictures such as hairstyles, clothing, and accessories from the provided sheets, paste them onto the template, and label the parts, such as “raincoat” or “blue eyes”. After completing the activity, pupils present their character by reading the paragraph. The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them.

Job titles (e.g., doctor, teacher, farmer) are written on small pieces of paper and placed in a box. Each pupil draws a job from the box, finds the matching family member on the wall, and forms a sentence using the job. Pupils are not given action verbs and must think of them independently.For example:* If a pupil draws “doctor”, they say: “Uncle John is a doctor. He helps people”.* If a pupil draws “teacher”, they say: “Aunt Janet is a teacher. She teaches students”.The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them.

One pupil closes their eyes and picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or a season on it (e.g., a sun for sunny, snowflakes for winter). They put the hat on without seeing the picture.Their peer looks at the hat and uses only facial expressions, gestures, or mimics to help the other pupil guess the correct word from the list written on the board. To make it easier, the teacher writes all possible words (e.g., sunny, rainy, winter, spring) on the board beforehand. For example, if the hat shows “windy”, the peer might puff their cheeks and pretend to blow air. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by selecting the word from the board.

The answer cards are placed face-up on the table, while the question cards are kept in a box face-down. Each group takes turns being the reader. The reader draws a question card, reads it aloud, and the other groups collaborate to quickly find and slap the correct answer card on the table.Questions:* What do you do at school in the morning?* What is your favourite school activity?* What are you doing at school now?Answers:* We have a school assembly every morning.* My favourite school activity is the drama performance.* We are having lunch now.Each correct match earns a point for the group. The game continues until all questions are matched. The group with the most points wins, encouraging teamwork and helping pupils improve their understanding of school-themed vocabulary and sentence structures.

Pupils play this game using image cards placed face-up on the table and word cards read aloud. In each round, one pupil acts as the “reader” and picks a word card to read aloud. Other pupils quickly identify and tap the correct image card. The first pupil to tap the correct card earns a point, while tapping the wrong card means losing their turn for that round. At the end of the game, the pupil or group with the most points wins. This activity support  vocabulary building and visual memory in a fun and engaging way. The teacher provides positive feedback to encourage them.

One pupil closes their eyes and randomly picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or season on it (e.g., a sunny day, winter snow). The pupil puts the hat on without looking at the picture. Their peer looks at the hat and gives clues by saying sentences such as, “It’s cold”, or “It’s cloudy”. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by asking questions such as, “Is it snowy?” or “Is it summer?”. Each correct guess earns the pair a point. The game continues with pairs taking turns, and the pair with the most points wins. Thisactivity practices vocabulary in a fun and interactive way while encouraging speaking and listening skills.The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To describe seasons and weather conditions in English by using the target vocabulary.Activity 1: Hat Guessing Game with MimicsPupils work in pairs. One pupil closes their eyes and picks a hat with a picture of a weather condition or a season on it (e.g., a sun for sunny, snowflakes for winter). They put the hat on without seeing the picture.Their peer looks at the hat and uses only facial expressions, gestures, or mimics to help the other pupil guess the correct word from the list written on the board. To make it easier, the teacher writes all possible words (e.g., sunny, rainy, winter, spring) on the board beforehand. For example, if the hat shows “windy”, the peer might puff their cheeks and pretend to blow air. The pupil wearing the hat guesses by selecting the word from the board. If they guess correctly, the pair earns a point. The game continues with pairs taking turns.The teacher provides positive feedback to encourage them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.THEME 3ExpansionObjective: To describe and talk about clothing and clothing preferences in English by using the target vocabulary and target chunks.Activity 1: Design the CharacterEach pupil is given a paragraph describing a character’s physical appearance, clothing, and personality traits. For example: “The character has wavy hair and blue eyes. She/He is wearing a raincoat, leggings, and slippers. She/He is very kind and enjoys quiet activities”. Pupils use the description to design the character on a blank person template. They cut out pictures such as hairstyles, clothing, and accessories from the provided sheets, paste them onto the template, and label the parts, such as “raincoat” or “blue eyes”. After completing the activity, pupils present their character by reading the paragraph. The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them.

Job titles (e.g., doctor, teacher, farmer) are written on small pieces of paper and placed in a box. Each pupil draws a job from the box, finds the matching family member on the wall, and forms a sentence using the job. Pupils are not given action verbs and must think of them independently.For example:* If a pupil draws “doctor”, they say: “Uncle John is a doctor. He helps people”.* If a pupil draws “teacher”, they say: “Aunt Janet is a teacher. She teaches students”.The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them.

This activity helps pupils connect dishes with their countries of origin while practicing vocabulary and sentence structure. The teacher provides positive feedback to motivate them. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by usingemoticons.",

They will describe their classroom rules, their daily and study routines, and the roles and responsibilities of their classmates. Students will include what subjects they study during the week and talk about their timetable. They will use some cardinal numbers (100-500) to describe the number of books or pencils in their classroom and some ordinal numbers (1-50) to talk about activities, such as, “Our first activity is reading, and our fifth activity is science”. Students will make their article colourful and creative by drawing a picture of their classroom and labelling it with words such as “teacher’s desk”, “bookshelf”, and “calendar” etc. Finally, they will give their article a title, such as “My Fantastic Classroom Life!” The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.",

The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.Students will imagine they are food festival organisers and create a poster for an international food festival called “Tastes of the World”. They will choose three countries from different continents and show their national dishes. Students will write the names of the countries, their continents, and the dishes they are famous for. For example, they might write: eg. Türkiye (Eurasia)-Stuffed peppers Italy (Europe)-Pizza, Japan (Asia)-Sushi, and Mexico (North America)-Tacos. They will decorate their posters with drawings or pictures and write a short invitation at the bottom, such as “Come and taste the delicious food from around the world!” Finally, students will present their posters to the class. The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.",

She/he divides the class into pairs/groups. The teacher begins the activity by choosing a card and giving an example (e.g. “What will you do if you are from another planet?”) and asks the students to choose a card and ask similar questions to each other in turns. Then, the students are supposed to choose and write down the most creative answer and write one of their wishes about their own planet. When they all finish their conversations each pair/group goes to the board to share their answer and wish with their classmates. The rest of the class is given with a form including five stars that can be used to evaluate pair/group performance. They will be engaged by colouring the stars to choose the most creative answer while listening to their classmates. The teacher gives constructive feedback to each pair.

In this project, each student or group will design a tour booklet, video, or live presentation that are related to different parts of their classroom life. They will act as guides to highlight technological tools like computers, Smart Boards, and headphones explaining how each tool helps students learn things. They will also share their favourite learning activities and describe why they enjoy those activities. Additionally, they can work with cardinal numbers (500-1000) and ordinal numbers (50-100) by creating fun number challENG.es, scavENG.er hunts, and/or ranking activities around the classroom. The tour experience should include drawings, photographs or short stories for making it interactive, informative, and full of surprises for their audience.

They will begin by researching schools in different parts of the world and learn about their significant features, activities, and traditions. Next, they think about the clubs and activities of schools. They will compare these schools to their own school by focusing on extracurricular activities like sports, music, art, or science clubs. They will create a creative project, such as a blog, presentation including drawings, photographs, or facts about a school club they enjoy or would like to join. They will share their findings and ideas with the class. The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.Students will take on the role of “Classroom Tour Guides” and create a detailed, creative tour experience for their classmates. In this project, each student or group will design a tour booklet, video, or live presentation that are related to different parts of their classroom life. They will act as guides to highlight technological tools like computers, Smart Boards, and headphones explaining how each tool helps students learn things. They will also share their favourite learning activities and describe why they enjoy those activities. Additionally, they can work with cardinal numbers (500-1000) and ordinal numbers (50-100) by creating fun number challENG.es, scavENG.er hunts, and/or ranking activities around the classroom. The tour experience should include drawings, photographs or short stories for making it interactive, informative, and full of surprises for their audience.

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.Target Social Language Expressions in Use: Can you give me a hand (with this question)? You nailed it! High five! Yay! I got it right! Work smarter, not harder! I’m a quick study! Target Phonological Sounds in Use: Consonants: m, n Consonants: m; (/ɛm/,/m/); n: (/ɛn/, /n/, silent /n/) *No pronunciation symbols will be included in any material written for the pupils, (only) the sounds will be practised through pronunciation activities in the theme.",

    "olcme_degerlendirme": "Students will take on the role of “Classroom Tour Guides” and create a detailed, creative tour experience for their classmates. In this project, each student or group will design a tour booklet, video, or live presentation that are related to different parts of their classroom life. They will act as guides to highlight technological tools like computers, Smart Boards, and headphones explaining how each tool helps students learn things. They will also share their favourite learning activities and describe why they enjoy those activities. Additionally, they can work with cardinal numbers (500-1000) and ordinal numbers (50-100) by creating fun number challENG.es, scavENG.er hunts, and/or ranking activities around the classroom. The tour experience should include drawings, photographs or short stories for making it interactive, informative, and full of surprises for their audience. The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.Students will create a short, illustrated story book called “Staying Healthy Adventures”. In their story, they will include a main character who gets sick (e.g. a child with a cold or a stomachache) and show how they recover by following good health tips. The story should include vocabulary about body parts (e.g. “head”, “stomach”), illnesses (e.g. “fever”, “cough”), and healthy habits (e.g. “eating fruits”, “exercising”). Students will write simple sentences for each page and draw colourful pictures to match the story. For example: “Yasemin has got a sore throat. She should drink warm tea and have a rest”. After finishing their storybooks, students will share them with the class. The assignment will be evaluated by using a rubric scheme, a rating scale, and/or a marking scheme.",

Activity 1: Creating a Class Learning Calendar The teacher divides the class into pairs or small groups of 3-4 students, and asks each group to prepare a weekly learning calendar for their class by deciding what types of activities to include, e.g. “class discussions, quizzes, and presentations”. Each group presents their learning calendar to the class. During the presentation, the rest of the class listens very carefully and asks further follow-up questions about the reasons behind their choices. The teacher gives constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and appropriate use of target vocabulary and grammatical chunks and their presentation. Students write down one thing they did well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation: “I gave you 4 stars because your pronunciation is good, but you should give more details”.

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.Target Social Language Expressions in Use: This house is a hidden gem! This street is the backbone of our city! This neighbourhood always buzzes with activity! Target Phonological Sounds in Use: Consonants: s, t Consonants: (/s/, /ɛs/, /z/, silent /s/); t: (/tiː/, /t/, silent /t/); v: (/viː/, /v/)",

Activity 1: Virtual City Walk The teacher organises a whole class brainstorming session on the cultural and historic sites in the neighbourhood and the city and writes them on the board. The class is divided into small groups, and each group chooses a specific place from the list and prepares a short presentation. The teacher asks students to act as tour guides to describe the sites using the target language. Each group presents their virtual city walk to the class. The rest of the class can ask follow-up questions about the places by encouraging further practice of the target grammar, e.g. “What can we see if we visit the museum?” or “Shall we take a boat ride along the river?”. The teacher gives constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and appropriate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they did well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation such as: “I am giving you 4 stars because your pronunciation is good, but you should give more details”.

Activity 1: Global Sports Reporter The students work in pairs to investigate a less known sports event (including the ones in Türkiye) that they choose as a sports reporter. Each pair prepares a mini report on the recommendations for participants and spectators, the rules that athletes need to follow, and statements from experts. Each pair presents their report, and the rest of the class tries to think of one more recommendation on the less known sports event to make it a more widely known one in the world. The teacher gives constructive feedback on the content, vocabulary use, grammar use, and presentation skills. The pairs reflect on their experience of investigating less known sports events with some simple sentences, e.g. “It was…….” or “I really liked………”. The students also reflect on which sports event and which recommendation they like most.

Activity 1: Save the Species Campaign The students work in pairs and choose an endangered species, e.g. tigers, sea turtles and/or pandas and act as campaigners to create awareness about endangered animals in society. The teacher provides a list of points for students to include in their reports and a text on each species so that pairs can read and find out why it is endangered and what actions caused the problem. The pairs also prepare suggestions for protecting the species and present their campaign to the class. The teacher gives constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and appropriate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they have done well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation: “I gave you 4 stars because your word choice and use is good, but you should give more details.” The students reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity.

Activity 1: Save the Species Campaign The students work in pairs and choose an endangered species, e.g. tigers, sea turtles and/or pandas and act as campaigners to create awareness about endangered animals in society. The teacher provides a list of points for students to include in their reports and a text on each species so that pairs can read and find out why it is endangered and what actions caused the problem. The pairs also prepare suggestions for protecting the species and present their campaign to the class. The teacher gives constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and appropriate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they have done well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation: “I gave you 4 stars because your word choice and use is good, but you should give more details.” The students reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity.

What could it say?” Students discuss their scenarios in pairs or groups and write sentences by completing the sentence beginnings prepared by the teacher, e.g. “It could say_____________”. Students share their sentences with the class and the rest of the class chooses a follow-up question from a box and asks, e.g. “What else will humans build in space?” or “Why do you think they used robots?” The teacher gives a target grammar-chunk bank to students as support to answer the questions. The teacher gives constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and appropriate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they have done well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation: “I gave you 4 stars because your language use is good but you should give more details”. The students will reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity.",

About “Background Grammatical Structures in Use”: The “Background Grammatical Structures” in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contibute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.Target Social Language Expressions in Use: She was over the moon with happiness! I was lost in space feeling confused! She was on another planet while the teacher was talking! The sky’s the limit for the future of technology!Target Phonological Sounds in Use: Consonants: y, z Consonants: y: (/waɪ/, /j/, /ɪ/, /iː/); z: /(zed/ (Br), /ziː/ (AmE), /z/) *No pronunciation symbols will be included in any material written for the pupils, (only) the sounds will be practised through pronunciation activities in the theme.",
