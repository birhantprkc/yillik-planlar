They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Future Tense (Positive, negative, Interrogative): (What (do you think) will happen in the future? (I think) robots will help people in the future. People will travel to other planets. Scientists will invent new machines to explore space. Time travellers will change history. People will live in virtual reality worlds.)\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing events and happenings (in films).\n-Use of the Simple Future Tense: Describing predictions, expressing what speakers believe and expect, explaining speakers’ opinions or guesses about the future, describing advice, recommendations (and expectations).\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nThis (film) is a breath of fresh air! This (film) is not my cup of tea!\nI’m not brave enough to watch this!

Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Future Tense (Positive, negative, Interrogative): (What (do you think) will happen in the future? (I think) robots will help people in the future. People will travel to other planets. Scientists will invent new machines to explore space. Time travellers will change history. People will live in virtual reality worlds.)\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing events and happenings (in films).\n-Use of the Simple Future Tense: Describing predictions, expressing what speakers believe and expect, explaining speakers’ opinions or guesses about the future, describing advice, recommendations (and expectations).\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nThis (film) is a breath of fresh air! This (film) is not my cup of tea!\nI’m not brave enough to watch this! What’s next?\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nDiphthong: o, oe, owoa, ou, eau: /əʊ/ Consonants: y: (/j/, /i/; z: (/z/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Language Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Present Tense: (Adventure films show exciting places and happening.)\n*About “Background Grammatical Structures in Use”:\nThe “Background Grammatical Structures” in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Future Tense (Positive, negative, Interrogative): (What (do you think) will happen in the future? (I think) robots will help people in the future. People will travel to other planets. Scientists will invent new machines to explore space. Time travellers will change history. People will live in virtual reality worlds.)\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing events and happenings (in films).\n-Use of the Simple Future Tense: Describing predictions, expressing what speakers believe and expect, explaining speakers’ opinions or guesses about the future, describing advice, recommendations (and expectations).\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nThis (film) is a breath of fresh air! This (film) is not my cup of tea!\nI’m not brave enough to watch this! What’s next?\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nDiphthong: o, oe, owoa, ou, eau: /əʊ/ Consonants: y: (/j/, /i/; z: (/z/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",
