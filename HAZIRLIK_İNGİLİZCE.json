This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Language Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use: -Imperatives: Expressing instructions for rules (Don’t be late for class! Take care of school property! Don’t shout in the corridors (hallways -AmE)! Keep the school clean and tidy! Be polite and respectful to others! Don’t use mobile phones (cell phone-AmE) at school! Follow safety rules at school!)\n*About ''Background Grammatical Structures in Use'': The ''Background Grammatical Structures'' in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use: -The Simple Present Tense (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (She always arrives at school at 8 o’clock every day. We have an assembly every Monday. The bell rings at 9 o’clock in the morning every day) (We don’t skip lessons.) (Do you have lunch at school?)\n -Modals: Can/can’t, must/mustn’t, have to/has to, do not/does not have to \n-Must (for obligation in present): (The caretaker must keep the school clean.) \n-Mustn't (for prohibition): (You mustn’t run at school.) \n-Can’t (for prohibition): (You can’t enter the library now!) \n-Have to/has to (for obligation in present time): (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms) (I have to take responsibility for arriving at school on time.) (You don’t have to leave school that early.) (Does she have to go?) \n-Must vs have to/has to: (The teacher must be a good example for the students.) (The teacher has to prepare lesson plans.) \n-Can (for permission): (Can I leave early today?) \n-Can (for requests): (Can you pass the book, please?)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use: \n-Imperatives: Expressing instructions for rules.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use: \n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing peoples’ roles and responsibilities; describing routines, activities and events at school. \n-Use of modals: \nMust: Describing personal and specific obligations on the part of the speaker. \nHave to/has to: Describing general, external, and impersonal obligation that resulting from a fact or a rule. \nCan: Describing permission and requests.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use: \nChill out! Relax! \nNo pain, no gain! \nThis is not a big deal! \nDon’t bend the rules! \nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use: Intonation of positive statements.\n -Vowel: a: \n-Vowel: a (/ae/, /aeı/, /ə/, /a:/, /eɪ/, a:/, /a/, /ɔː/, /eə/) \n-Consonants: b: \n-Consonants: (/b/), silent /b/) \n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught.

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Shall (for suggestion): (Shall we write this together?)\n- There is/There are (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (There is an assembly at school at 9 o'clock. There isn’t / is not an assembly at school at 9 o’clock. Is there and assembly at 9 o’clock at school?) (There are a lot of students in the assembly). (There aren’t any students in the assembly.)

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Shall (for suggestion): (Shall we write this together?)\n- There is/There are (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (There is an assembly at school at 9 o'clock. There isn’t / is not an assembly at school at 9 o’clock. Is there and assembly at 9 o’clock at school?) (There are a lot of students in the assembly). (There aren’t any students in the assembly.) (Are there any students in the assembly?)\n-Modals: (Can/Can’t): (Can we work together on this project?) (You can’t start the new project.)\nMust/Mustn’t: (You must show respect to your teachers and friends.) (You mustn’t disturb your classmates. They are studying now.)\n-Imperatives: (Don’t disturb others in class!) (Please help your friends!)\nFunctions of Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing responsibilities of different roles, daily routines and study routines (in a classroom).\n-Use of Modals:\nMust: Asking and answering for prohibitions.\nCan/can’t: Asking and answering for possibilities.\n-Use of Imperatives: Giving instructions.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of “There is/There are” (present): Describing rules.\n-Use of “Shall”: Asking for suggestions.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nGood job!\nThank you for your help!\nI’m grateful for your assistance!\nKeep up the good work!\nWhat does it mean?\nExcuse me, can I speak to you?\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nIntonation of negative statements\nConsonants: c, d\nConsonants: c: (/si/, /k/); d: (/d/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught.

They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Present Tense (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (I always wear my school uniform on weekdays. I don’t/ do not wear my school uniform on weekdays. Do you wear your school uniform on weekdays?) (What does s/he look like? S/He looks very nice). (What kind of person is s/he?

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of “Target Grammatical Structures” without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered “Target Grammatical Structures” themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Simple Present Tense (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (I always wear my school uniform on weekdays. I don’t/ do not wear my school uniform on weekdays. Do you wear your school uniform on weekdays?) (What does s/he look like? S/He looks very nice). (What kind of person is s/he?

    "olcme_degerlendirme": "Assessment and Evaluation Scheme for Upper Secondary Schools\n\nPERFORMANCE ASSIGNMENT: Students will create a comprehensive project about the attractions,\nrecreational places, services, and transport in their neighbourhood and city. The project will include\nidentifying key attractions such as parks, historical sites, museums, or shopping areas, and describing \nhow these places contribute to the lifestyle of the community. Additionally, students will explore the\nessential services in their area, such as schools, hospitals, libraries, and community centres, and explain their significance in meeting the needs of residents. Transportation will also be a focus, with students checking the available options, including public transport, walking and cycling routes, and road networks, and discussing simply and talking about them. Students will design a visual presentation to accompany their project, such as a map or infographic, highlighting the locations of attractions, services, and transportation routes. They are encouraged to add photos, drawings, or symbols to make their work more engaging. Alongside the visual component, students will simply write a reflection on how these aspects contribute to making their neighbourhood and city liveable, discussing any challenges they observe, such as traffic or limited services, and proposing solutions for improvement. Finally, students will present their projects to the class, using their visuals to support a clear and engaging explanation. The assignment will be evaluated by using rubrics and a marking scheme.",

These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n- The Present Perfect Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (They’ve / have eaten all the food since yesterday evening. They haven’t / have not eaten all the food yesterday.

They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Zero Conditional: (If you travel to Mars, you need to wear a spacesuit because there is no oxygen in the atmosphere.)\n-First Conditional (1): (If the weather on Earth continues to change, we will experience more natural disasters like cyclones.)\n-With ''Unless'': (Unless we protect the environment, pollution will continue to harm the planet.)\n-With ''If'': (If we discover new planets, we can learn more about the possibility of life in space.)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Simple Future Tense: Talking about predictions, plans, promises, or decisions about the future.\n-Use of the Simple Present Tense: Describing facts and general truths.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the ''Zero Conditional'': Describing general truths, facts, or habitual actions that are always true if certain conditions are met\n-Use of the ''First Conditional (1)'': Describing possible or likely outcomes in the future based on a condition being fulfilled\n-Use of ''Unless'': Expressing a condition in a negative form, indicating something will happen only if the condition is not met\n-Use of ''If'': Introducing a condition to describe potential actions, situations, or consequences, often\nexpressing possibility or uncertainty\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nI’m lost in the cosmos!\nShe’s over the moon!\nStarry eyed dreams!\nWe’re orbiting the same idea!\nThat’s the gravity of the situation!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nConsonant: n, (n-g)\nn: (/ɛn/, /n/); ng: (/ng/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",

These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Passive Voice in Present Tenses (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Passive Present (The homework is given by the teacher every day.

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Zero conditional: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (If you eat healthy food, you stay healthy. If you don’t / do not eat healthy food, you get ill more easily. What happens if you don’t / do not drink enough water?)\n- First Conditional (1): (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (If you eat more vegetables, you will feel better.

(That was the most relaxing holiday I’ve ever had.)\n*About ''Background Grammatical Structures in Use'':\nThe ''Background Grammatical Structures'' in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Second Conditional (2): (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (If I had more time, I would travel the world.

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Shall we attend the meeting?)\n-''Can'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Can you tell me the fastest way to get to the city centre?)\n-''Might'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Might we take a different route to the concert to avoid traffic?\n*About ''Background Grammatical Structures in Use'':\nThe ''Background Grammatical Structures'' in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Passive Voice with Modals: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (The streets must be cleaned\nevery morning. The streets can’t be / cannot be cleaned in the morning. Might the streets be cleaned in the morning?)\n-''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Shall we attend the meeting?)\n-''Can'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Can you tell me the fastest way to get to the city centre?)\n-''Might'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Might we take a different route to the concert to avoid traffic?)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of ''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: Expressing a willingness to do something for someone and making polite suggestions and/or offers, usually with the first person (I/we).\n-Use of ''Can'' for Polite requests and Probability: Making polite requests, especially when asking for permission or asking someone to do something, and expressing possibility or probability, particularly when something is likely or achievable.\n-Use of ''Might'' for Polite requests and Probability: Expressing more formal or tentative polite requests\nthan ''can'', showing respect and politeness when asking for permission or making a suggestion. Expressing probability or possibility when something is less certain than with ''can'' or ''will''.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of Passive Voice with Modals: Emphasising the action or the object of the sentence rather than the\nsubject, especially when the doer is unknown, implied or unimportant.\n-Use of ''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: Expressing a willingness to do something for someone and making polite suggestions and/or offers, usually with the first person (I/we).\n-Use of ''Can'' for Polite requests and Probability: Making polite requests, especially when asking for permission or asking someone to do something, and expressing possibility or probability, particularly when something is likely or achievable.\n-Use of ''Might'' for Polite requests and Probability: Expressing more formal or tentative polite requests\nthan ''can'', showing respect and politeness when asking for permission or making a suggestion. Expressing probability or possibility when something is less certain than with ''can'' or ''will''.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nThat’s a blast from the past!\nThis museum is steeped in history!\nThis historical ruin is a window into the past!\nThis food festival is a feast for the senses!\nThis city never sleeps!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nVowel: u\nVowel: u: (/juː/, /ʌ/, /juː/, silent /u/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught.

The project will start by identifying significant cultural and historical sites, such as monuments, museums, or landmarks, and explaining their importance to the community. Students will also research festivals and events that take place in their\narea, discussing how these celebrations bring people together and reflect local traditions. Additionally, the\nproject will focus on identifying common problems in the neighbourhood and city, such as traffic, pollution,\nor lack of public spaces, and students will propose practical solutions to address these issues. The project\nwill include a written report summarising the findings, supported by visuals such as photographs, maps,\nor charts to enhance the presentation. Students are encouraged to interview local residents or use other\nresources to gather more insights into the topics. Along with the report, students will prepare a short oral\npresentation to share their findings with the class, focusing on the most interesting cultural or historical\naspects, key festivals, and the proposed solutions to local problems.

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Shall we attend the meeting?)\n-''Can'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Can you tell me the fastest way to get to the city centre?)\n-''Might'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Might we take a different route to the concert to avoid traffic?\n*About ''Background Grammatical Structures in Use'':\nThe ''Background Grammatical Structures'' in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Passive Voice with Modals: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (The streets must be cleaned\nevery morning. The streets can’t be / cannot be cleaned in the morning. Might the streets be cleaned in the morning?)\n-''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Shall we attend the meeting?)\n-''Can'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Can you tell me the fastest way to get to the city centre?)\n-''Might'' for Polite Requests and Probability: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): Might we take a different route to the concert to avoid traffic?)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of ''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: Expressing a willingness to do something for someone and making polite suggestions and/or offers, usually with the first person (I/we).\n-Use of ''Can'' for Polite requests and Probability: Making polite requests, especially when asking for permission or asking someone to do something, and expressing possibility or probability, particularly when something is likely or achievable.\n-Use of ''Might'' for Polite requests and Probability: Expressing more formal or tentative polite requests\nthan ''can'', showing respect and politeness when asking for permission or making a suggestion. Expressing probability or possibility when something is less certain than with ''can'' or ''will''.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of Passive Voice with Modals: Emphasising the action or the object of the sentence rather than the\nsubject, especially when the doer is unknown, implied or unimportant.\n-Use of ''Shall'' for Suggestions and Polite Offers: Expressing a willingness to do something for someone and making polite suggestions and/or offers, usually with the first person (I/we).\n-Use of ''Can'' for Polite requests and Probability: Making polite requests, especially when asking for permission or asking someone to do something, and expressing possibility or probability, particularly when something is likely or achievable.\n-Use of ''Might'' for Polite requests and Probability: Expressing more formal or tentative polite requests\nthan ''can'', showing respect and politeness when asking for permission or making a suggestion. Expressing probability or possibility when something is less certain than with ''can'' or ''will''.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nThat’s a blast from the past!\nThis museum is steeped in history!\nThis historical ruin is a window into the past!\nThis food festival is a feast for the senses!\nThis city never sleeps!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nVowel: u\nVowel: u: (/juː/, /ʌ/, /juː/, silent /u/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught.

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use\n-The Past Perfect Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (The team had cleaned the beach before the tourists came).

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Past Perfect Progressive Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms) (The volunteers had been helping animals before the fire ended. The volunteers hadn’t / had not been helping animals before the fire ended. Had the volunteers been helping animals before the fire ended?)\n-Third Conditional (3) (Unreal Past Situations): If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam); (Hypothetical outcomes in the past: We would have met at the café, if you had remembered); (Regret or criticism: If I had known about traffic, I would have left earlier.)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Tense: Describing an action or state completed before another action or point in the past.\n-Use of ''Needn’t, Mustn’t (for obligation)'': Expressing strong obligation (and prohibition) not to do something.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Progressive Tense: Describes an action that was going over a period of time before another action or point in the past. \n-Use of the Third Conditional (3): Expressing an unreal past situation and its imagined (hypothetical) result situations.\n-Use of Modals in the past with the Third Conditional (3): Expressing lack of necessity and absence of obligation.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nLet’s put a drop in the ocean!\nOur forests are running on empty!\nLive off the land!\nThat’s the tip of the iceberg!\nPollution is a cloud on the horizon!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nConsonants: x, y\nConsonants: x: (/ɛks/, /ks/, /gz/); y: (/waɪ/, /j/, /ɪ/, /iː/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use\n-The Past Perfect Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (The team had cleaned the beach before the tourists came).

They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Past Perfect Progressive Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms) (The volunteers had been helping animals before the fire ended. The volunteers hadn’t / had not been helping animals before the fire ended. Had the volunteers been helping animals before the fire ended?)\n-Third Conditional (3) (Unreal Past Situations): If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam); (Hypothetical outcomes in the past: We would have met at the café, if you had remembered); (Regret or criticism: If I had known about traffic, I would have left earlier.)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Tense: Describing an action or state completed before another action or point in the past.\n-Use of ''Needn’t, Mustn’t (for obligation)'': Expressing strong obligation (and prohibition) not to do something.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Progressive Tense: Describes an action that was going over a period of time before another action or point in the past. \n-Use of the Third Conditional (3): Expressing an unreal past situation and its imagined (hypothetical) result situations.\n-Use of Modals in the past with the Third Conditional (3): Expressing lack of necessity and absence of obligation.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nLet’s put a drop in the ocean!\nOur forests are running on empty!\nLive off the land!\nThat’s the tip of the iceberg!\nPollution is a cloud on the horizon!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nConsonants: x, y\nConsonants: x: (/ɛks/, /ks/, /gz/); y: (/waɪ/, /j/, /ɪ/, /iː/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",

This consideration will be age-and-level appropriate and selected with the Turkish learners’ social and cultural context in mind. A table of contents for this section is provided in the introduction to the whole English Curriculum.\nBackground Grammatical Structures in Use\n-The Past Perfect Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms): (The team had cleaned the beach before the tourists came). The team hadn’t / had not cleaned the beach before the tourists came). (Had the team cleaned the beach before the tourists came?)\n-Needn’t, Mustn’t (for Obligation): (You needn’t come to shopping if you are busy) (You mustn’t go out of the school now.)\n*About ''Background Grammatical Structures in Use'':\nThe ''Background Grammatical Structures'' in this section are not only revisional but also serve as contextual support and contribute to meaning-making. They are intended to be used within the theme to help students grasp the meaning of the language constructed through the use of ''Target Grammatical Structures'' without being explicitly taught. These structures are not considered ''Target Grammatical Structures'' themselves rather they function as a part of the facilitation process, supporting both the target forms and the contexts in which they are used. They provide opportunities for learning through revised and scaffolded language.\nTarget Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-The Past Perfect Progressive Tense: (Positive, Negative, and Interrogative Forms) (The volunteers had been helping animals before the fire ended. The volunteers hadn’t / had not been helping animals before the fire ended. Had the volunteers been helping animals before the fire ended?)\n-Third Conditional (3) (Unreal Past Situations): If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam); (Hypothetical outcomes in the past: We would have met at the café, if you had remembered); (Regret or criticism: If I had known about traffic, I would have left earlier.)\nFunctions of the Background Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Tense: Describing an action or state completed before another action or point in the past.\n-Use of ''Needn’t, Mustn’t (for obligation)'': Expressing strong obligation (and prohibition) not to do something.\nFunctions of the Target Grammatical Structures in Use:\n-Use of the Past Perfect Progressive Tense: Describes an action that was going over a period of time before another action or point in the past. \n-Use of the Third Conditional (3): Expressing an unreal past situation and its imagined (hypothetical) result situations.\n-Use of Modals in the past with the Third Conditional (3): Expressing lack of necessity and absence of obligation.\nTarget Social Language Expressions in Use:\nLet’s put a drop in the ocean!\nOur forests are running on empty!\nLive off the land!\nThat’s the tip of the iceberg!\nPollution is a cloud on the horizon!\nTarget Phonological Sounds in Use:\nConsonants: x, y\nConsonants: x: (/ɛks/, /ks/, /gz/); y: (/waɪ/, /j/, /ɪ/, /iː/)\n*(Phonetic symbols will not be taught. Only sounds will be practised through the target words in the theme.)",
