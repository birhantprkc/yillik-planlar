This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for pupils to learn about the concept of “school” and to gain the knowledge of “what a school is, what parts and places it can have, and what kind of people are in it” in English.

This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for pupils to learn about the concept of “school” and to gain the knowledge of “what a school is, what parts and places it can have, and what kind of people are in it” in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have a link for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it but thinking and imagining through it yet.Before classroom activities, a tour of the school could be carried out with the pupils to help them recall their background knowledge about the concept of “school” in their own language, Turkish in relation to school, that is, places, people, and parts of the school without mentioning any English words just to remember what a school is and what the parts/places/people of it are.

For example, they can point correctly to a visual such as a picture, poster, cartoon etc. of the current concepts in the theme in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “school life” with its components such as “greetings and introductions at school; people and places at school; days of the week; national days and celebrations” in their own language. Pupils’ experience as being a pupil in a primary school is accepted as a basis for this theme. As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know greetings and introductions at school; people and places at school; days of the week; national days and celebrations are in their own language, Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “school” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for pupils to learn about the concept of “school” and to gain the knowledge of “what a school is, what parts and places it can have, and what kind of people are in it” in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have a link for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it but thinking and imagining through it yet.Before classroom activities, a tour of the school could be carried out with the pupils to help them recall their background knowledge about the concept of “school” in their own language, Turkish in relation to school, that is, places, people, and parts of the school without mentioning any English words just to remember what a school is and what the parts/places/people of it are. They can draw pictures of what they have seen during the tour when they go back to their classrooms. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the current topic/theme (concept) “school life” by using their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the present activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish. It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language about the current concept. It is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about it in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles.It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the current concept and related words and language chunks in English as a foreign language.Many activities may apply to calling the background knowledge of pupils. For example, they can point correctly to a visual such as a picture, poster, cartoon etc. of the current concepts in the theme in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish. Any other similar activities could be used to activate students’ background knowledge and to establish links.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about the current content (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the current content through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic. Pupils, they can know what a classroom is, what a classroom context is like, what the components of a classroom are, how the teachers lead and facilitate them with classroom instructions, how they understand him/her, and follow and carry out the instructions (which they already know as concepts in Turkish) and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “classroom” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being.

As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures.

An interactive word wall is set up where pictures of basic classroom instructions can be drawn or target language chunks can be written under the picture using basic classroom instructions, such as “Come here!, Look at me!, Look here!, Open the door!, Close the door! etc…”. Then working in pairs, one pupil says the instruction correctly and the other pupil acts it out and repeats the chunk. Then they do the action and say the chunk together. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: BingoBingo cards are made with pictures of classroom objects and furniture in different colours. Colours are called out, and pupils mark their cards that are only colours. After marking, they use the colour in a target language chunk and say it. The first pupil to complete a row shouts “Bingo!” and then they repeat as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Hop and sayA number line is created on the floor with tape. A number is called out, and the pupils have to hop to that number. When they hop, they have to say the number correctly. To increase the level of difficulty, basic Maths problems are called out (e.g., “Hop to 5 + 3”). They repeat the numbers as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: SongA song consisting of the basic short classroom instructions (Stand up! /Sit down! /Listen! /Come here! / Be quiet! /Open the door! /Close the door!) can be used as a consolidation activity. The pupils can repeat the song after the tape to remember and revise the classroom instructions. Pupils choose a peer and sing a part of the song at random and have her/his peer act it out.

As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic. Pupils, they can know what a classroom is, what a classroom context is like, what the components of a classroom are, how the teachers lead and facilitate them with classroom instructions, how they understand him/her, and follow and carry out the instructions (which they already know as concepts in Turkish) and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “classroom” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for the pupils to learn about the concept of “classroom life” and to gain knowledge of “what a classroom is, what furniture and objects are in it and what and colours are in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures.

Pupils work in pairs to match the pictures with the correct words. An interactive word wall is set up where pictures of basic classroom instructions can be drawn or target language chunks can be written under the picture using basic classroom instructions, such as “Come here!, Look at me!, Look here!, Open the door!, Close the door! etc…”. Then working in pairs, one pupil says the instruction correctly and the other pupil acts it out and repeats the chunk. Then they do the action and say the chunk together. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: BingoBingo cards are made with pictures of classroom objects and furniture in different colours. Colours are called out, and pupils mark their cards that are only colours. After marking, they use the colour in a target language chunk and say it. The first pupil to complete a row shouts “Bingo!” and then they repeat as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Hop and sayA number line is created on the floor with tape. A number is called out, and the pupils have to hop to that number. When they hop, they have to say the number correctly. To increase the level of difficulty, basic Maths problems are called out (e.g., “Hop to 5 + 3”). They repeat the numbers as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: SongA song consisting of the basic short classroom instructions (Stand up! /Sit down! /Listen! /Come here! / Be quiet! /Open the door! /Close the door!) can be used as a consolidation activity. The pupils can repeat the song after the tape to remember and revise the classroom instructions. Pupils choose a peer and sing a part of the song at random and have her/his peer act it out.

As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic. Pupils, they can know what a classroom is, what a classroom context is like, what the components of a classroom are, how the teachers lead and facilitate them with classroom instructions, how they understand him/her, and follow and carry out the instructions (which they already know as concepts in Turkish) and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “classroom” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for the pupils to learn about the concept of “classroom life” and to gain knowledge of “what a classroom is, what furniture and objects are in it and what and colours are in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures.

Pupils work in pairs to match the pictures with the correct words. An interactive word wall is set up where pictures of basic classroom instructions can be drawn or target language chunks can be written under the picture using basic classroom instructions, such as “Come here!, Look at me!, Look here!, Open the door!, Close the door! etc…”. Then working in pairs, one pupil says the instruction correctly and the other pupil acts it out and repeats the chunk. Then they do the action and say the chunk together. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: BingoBingo cards are made with pictures of classroom objects and furniture in different colours. Colours are called out, and pupils mark their cards that are only colours. After marking, they use the colour in a target language chunk and say it. The first pupil to complete a row shouts “Bingo!” and then they repeat as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Hop and sayA number line is created on the floor with tape. A number is called out, and the pupils have to hop to that number. When they hop, they have to say the number correctly. To increase the level of difficulty, basic Maths problems are called out (e.g., “Hop to 5 + 3”). They repeat the numbers as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: SongA song consisting of the basic short classroom instructions (Stand up! /Sit down! /Listen! /Come here! / Be quiet! /Open the door! /Close the door!) can be used as a consolidation activity. The pupils can repeat the song after the tape to remember and revise the classroom instructions. Pupils choose a peer and sing a part of the song at random and have her/his peer act it out.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “classroom life” with its components such as “classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours” in their own language. As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic. Pupils, they can know what a classroom is, what a classroom context is like, what the components of a classroom are, how the teachers lead and facilitate them with classroom instructions, how they understand him/her, and follow and carry out the instructions (which they already know as concepts in Turkish) and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “classroom” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for the pupils to learn about the concept of “classroom life” and to gain knowledge of “what a classroom is, what furniture and objects are in it and what and colours are in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “classroom life” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: BingoBingo cards are made with pictures of classroom objects and furniture in different colours. Colours are called out, and pupils mark their cards that are only colours. After marking, they use the colour in a target language chunk and say it. The first pupil to complete a row shouts “Bingo!” and then they repeat as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Hop and sayA number line is created on the floor with tape. A number is called out, and the pupils have to hop to that number. When they hop, they have to say the number correctly. To increase the level of difficulty, basic Maths problems are called out (e.g., “Hop to 5 + 3”). They repeat the numbers as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: SongA song consisting of the basic short classroom instructions (Stand up! /Sit down! /Listen! /Come here! / Be quiet! /Open the door! /Close the door!) can be used as a consolidation activity. The pupils can repeat the song after the tape to remember and revise the classroom instructions. Pupils choose a peer and sing a part of the song at random and have her/his peer act it out. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To practise and improve knowledge and skills for talking about classroom, classroom furniture, objects and instructions in English.Activity 1: Interactive vocabulary gameOne set of cards is made with pictures of objects in the classroom and another set with their names.

They copy the words that go with the pictures and do a show-and-tell to introduce them to the class. This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “classroom life” with its components such as “classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours” in their own language. As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what classroom instructions and language; classroom furniture, devices and objects; colours are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic. Pupils, they can know what a classroom is, what a classroom context is like, what the components of a classroom are, how the teachers lead and facilitate them with classroom instructions, how they understand him/her, and follow and carry out the instructions (which they already know as concepts in Turkish) and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “classroom” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that the physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for the pupils to learn about the concept of “classroom life” and to gain knowledge of “what a classroom is, what furniture and objects are in it and what and colours are in English. As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “classroom life” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

To increase the level of difficulty, basic Maths problems are called out (e.g., “Hop to 5 + 3”). They repeat the numbers as a whole class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: SongA song consisting of the basic short classroom instructions (Stand up! /Sit down! /Listen! /Come here! / Be quiet! /Open the door! /Close the door!) can be used as a consolidation activity. The pupils can repeat the song after the tape to remember and revise the classroom instructions. Pupils choose a peer and sing a part of the song at random and have her/his peer act it out.

Pupils’ experiences as being a pupil and a part of people in a classroom (so far) is taken as a basis for this theme/topic.

As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish. She/He could ask them to draw the picture of the place (classroom) they are in Turkish and ask them to keep the pictures for later. The activity can be evaluated with verbal praise.Establishing LinksPupils recall the concepts and associations related to the topic/theme “classroom life” by calling their preexisting background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything and without speaking any Turkish until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “classroom life”.It is only thinking about the presented visuals in their own language and, if necessary, and when asked using any words about the concept of “classroom” that they have already learnt/known in English at the very beginning of the process of learning about the current (new) theme/topic “classroom life”. The vocabulary about the concept of “school” and the language chunks “What’s/is it/this? It’s/is /This is….” in English from the previous theme could help them understand the present theme more easily.Connections between pre-existing knowledge regarding school (in their minds/heads) and the present information about the concept of “classroom” are made through meaningful and contextualised activities with visuals. The teacher could ask them to look around and think where they are and what kind of a place it is in Turkish to recall their background knowledge (in Turkish) about a classroom and what they can have in it without mentioning any English words. They do not talk or translate anything from Turkish into English as this is just a thinking exercise.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of classroom and pictures of classroom furniture, devices and objects in it and also “colours” correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher in English and/or with mimics and gestures.

Primary school pupils in Year 2 can know what a classroom is, what furniture and objects are in it and what are colours in Turkish. Pupils will know these and be able to express such situations in their own language but will not know how to say these things in a foreign language if this has not yet been covered in their curriculum. The knowledge of the concept of “classroom” that they have in their own language would prepare them to identify the same concepts later in their foreign language, English, in which they are assumed to be zero beginners.PrinciplesA classroom is introduced as a place where there are certain furniture and objects that function as important components of it. A classroom is an important context where initial social interactions of social communication such as classroom instructions, are practised naturally and authentically in EFL.70Key Concepts:Instructions, language, classroom, classroom instructions, classroom language, objects, devices, furniture, classroom objects, classroom devices, classroom furniture, conditions, colours.",

As they are accepted as zero-beginners, there is nothing to remind them of English, but they can be supported to have an imaginary association for this concept in their own language, Turkish, without speaking it in class.Before the main activities, the teacher could show them a classroom picture and ask them to say “yes” or “no” in English if they know what it is in Turkish.

Pupils know the most basic language chunks “What’s/is it? It’s/is -This is a…”, “What colour …?” which could help them ask and answer questions about many things about “the parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures.

Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Puppet gamePupils are introduced to the “My Funny Puppet” activity. Each pupil will draw a funny puppet from their imagination and label its body parts. Pupils are asked to draw their own puppet and label the body parts.In addition to the drawing, pupils are asked to make their puppet talk by using self-introduction phrases learned in the first theme along with body parts (e.g., “My name is … I have a pink nose; I have two yellow ears”). For presentation and sharing, the puppets are shown to the classmates, and the puppets with labelled body parts are displayed on the class bulletin board. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Dialogue gameA flashcard is shown, the word is said, and it is repeated by the pupils. Then, the pupils are asked to point to the corresponding body part on themselves. Additionally, high achiever pupils are asked to use the word in a sentence describing the body part and its colour. They are also encouraged to create a short dialogue with a peer.

Then, the pupils are asked to point to the corresponding part of their body. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Puppet gameA simple puppet template is given to the pupils. The positions of the body parts (e.g., head, arms, legs, eyes) are shown on the template. The template is coloured by the pupils, and the names of the body parts are written with the help of the teacher. The template is then cut out and the puppet is made.

(A digital 3D model can also be made).They copy the words that go with the pictures and do a show-and-tell to introduce them to the class. This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “personal life” with its components such as “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in their own language.As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what the parts of the body and physical features are; what clothes are; what the days of the week are, what ages and birthdays are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils know the most basic language chunks “What’s/is it? It’s/is -This is a…”, “What colour …?” which could help them ask and answer questions about many things about “the parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

(A digital 3D model can also be made).They copy the words that go with the pictures and do a show-and-tell to introduce them to the class. This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “personal life” with its components such as “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in their own language.As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what the parts of the body and physical features are; what clothes are; what the days of the week are, what ages and birthdays are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils know the most basic language chunks “What’s/is it? It’s/is -This is a…”, “What colour …?” which could help them ask and answer questions about many things about “the parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils repeat these words together, and the teacher shows and points to each part. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Puppet gamePupils are introduced to the “My Funny Puppet” activity. Each pupil will draw a funny puppet from their imagination and label its body parts. Pupils are asked to draw their own puppet and label the body parts.In addition to the drawing, pupils are asked to make their puppet talk by using self-introduction phrases learned in the first theme along with body parts (e.g., “My name is … I have a pink nose; I have two yellow ears”). For presentation and sharing, the puppets are shown to the classmates, and the puppets with labelled body parts are displayed on the class bulletin board. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Dialogue gameA flashcard is shown, the word is said, and it is repeated by the pupils. Then, the pupils are asked to point to the corresponding body part on themselves. Additionally, high achiever pupils are asked to use the word in a sentence describing the body part and its colour. They are also encouraged to create a short dialogue with a peer.

The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Puppet gamePupils are introduced to the “My Funny Puppet” activity. Each pupil will draw a funny puppet from their imagination and label its body parts. Pupils are asked to draw their own puppet and label the body parts.In addition to the drawing, pupils are asked to make their puppet talk by using self-introduction phrases learned in the first theme along with body parts (e.g., “My name is … I have a pink nose; I have two yellow ears”). For presentation and sharing, the puppets are shown to the classmates, and the puppets with labelled body parts are displayed on the class bulletin board. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Dialogue gameA flashcard is shown, the word is said, and it is repeated by the pupils. Then, the pupils are asked to point to the corresponding body part on themselves. Additionally, high achiever pupils are asked to use the word in a sentence describing the body part and its colour.

It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face!

They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately.

(A digital 3D model can also be made).They copy the words that go with the pictures and do a show-and-tell to introduce them to the class. This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “personal life” with its components such as “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in their own language.As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what the parts of the body and physical features are; what clothes are; what the days of the week are, what ages and birthdays are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils know the most basic language chunks “What’s/is it? It’s/is -This is a…”, “What colour …?” which could help them ask and answer questions about many things about “the parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures.

(A digital 3D model can also be made).They copy the words that go with the pictures and do a show-and-tell to introduce them to the class. This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on pupils’ knowledge of “personal life” with its components such as “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in their own language.As the pupils are seven-year-old children, they can know what the parts of the body and physical features are; what clothes are; what the days of the week are, what ages and birthdays are in their own language, Turkish. Pupils know the most basic language chunks “What’s/is it? It’s/is -This is a…”, “What colour …?” which could help them ask and answer questions about many things about “the parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. The basic colours in English (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) learnt in the previous theme can also be helpful in describing some body parts such as “I’ve got blue eyes” and clothes.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “personal life” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils are suitable for learning about their “parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions”. in English, taking into account their age, level of interest, aptitude for foreign language acquisition and learning, attitudes towards foreign language learning, and learning styles. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about this concept and related words and chunks in English (as a foreign language). A sample practice could be applied asking them to point to their body parts correctly when they are given instructions in Turkish or with mimics and gestures without speaking any English and not saying anything in Turkish.For pre-evaluation, the teacher could show a body (picture or real) with clothes then she/he could say in Turkish “Show me a face! Show me a head!”. The appropriate physical response is expected from the pupils, who show the so-called body parts. They do not speak Turkish or English during this activity. They just show the part of the body that the teacher says with physical responses and the teacher checks whether they know it in their own language. This can be evaluated by an observation scheme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept “personal life with parts of the body and physical features; clothes; days of the week, ages and birthdays; weather conditions” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge (they already have in their own language) about the current concept, some related pictures are displayed on the walls of the classroom or on the Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow begins in the class. The pictures could be of a doll’s body. All the body parts to be taught in the theme are coloured and highlighted separately. The pictures are shown to the pupils and they are asked if they know what they are about in Turkish without giving their English equivalents, as it is only a matter of thinking about the visuals presented in their own language as a whole and reflecting that they know what they are saying yes or no or nodding their heads. They do not translate anything from Turkish into English or vice versa, and it is a short conversation to familiarise them with the concept of body parts.Some questions can be asked in Turkish:Have you understood what these are? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads) Do you know these words in Turkish? (The answer is yes or no in Turkish or nodding their heads without saying the words in Turkish)An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a body and/or pictures of body parts in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses physically by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about body parts (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “body parts” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

They can use both digital resources and papers/cardboard. Then they can give feedback to each other using emoticons.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of family members in their own language. As Year 2 Primary school pupils, they can know what a family is and what its members are. It is also assumed that they know how to describe their physical traits such as the colour of their eyes or hair, in their own language, Turkish.They know some language chunks such as “This is … What colour…? as well as the basic colours (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) in English, that they learned in the previous themes, which could help them ask and answer questions about family members and their physical traits such as “My mother’s/ has got blue eyes” in this theme.As an initial start, a fun non-theme warm-up activity is done as an icebreaker to help the pupils feel positive and ready for the whole learning process in class for their well-being. This could be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to/singing a song/chant/rhyme and so on that does not require any knowledge of English and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils have the knowledge of their family members such as their father, mother, sister, brother, grandmother, and grandfather in their own language. This knowledge prepares them to identify the same concept in English as their foreign language. Besides, they could use some additional language elements such as colours (blue, green…), numbers (1-2) and basic adjectives (small, big…) to describe the physical features of family members in a simple way. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about family members and related physical descriptions using basic colours to talk about their eye colours or using adjectives such as small, big, long, and short in English. An example of an exercise might be to point correctly to family members in a picture by giving instructions in Turkish without speaking any English without letting the pupils speak Turkish or English. Instructions such as “Show me the father in this family!

Besides, they could use some additional language elements such as colours (blue, green…), numbers (1-2) and basic adjectives (small, big…) to describe the physical features of family members in a simple way. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about family members and related physical descriptions using basic colours to talk about their eye colours or using adjectives such as small, big, long, and short in English. An example of an exercise might be to point correctly to family members in a picture by giving instructions in Turkish without speaking any English without letting the pupils speak Turkish or English. Instructions such as “Show me the father in this family! Show me the grandfather in this family!” are given in Turkish and pupils can respond physically by pointing to the relevant family members without speaking.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “family and family members” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “family” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge about the concept of “family”, a very short cartoon film of a very famous and popular family known to the pupils is shown on the Smart Board before themain teaching/learning flow in the class begins.The teacher asks pupils to watch the film and they do it. When they have finished watching the film, the teacher asks them in Turkish what the film was about and wants the answer aloud in chorus as the whole class in Turkish: “… family!” The teacher asks them to think about this until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a family and pictures of family members in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “family” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

This could be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to/singing a song/chant/rhyme and so on that does not require any knowledge of English and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils have the knowledge of their family members such as their father, mother, sister, brother, grandmother, and grandfather in their own language. This knowledge prepares them to identify the same concept in English as their foreign language. Besides, they could use some additional language elements such as colours (blue, green…), numbers (1-2) and basic adjectives (small, big…) to describe the physical features of family members in a simple way. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about family members and related physical descriptions using basic colours to talk about their eye colours or using adjectives such as small, big, long, and short in English. An example of an exercise might be to point correctly to family members in a picture by giving instructions in Turkish without speaking any English without letting the pupils speak Turkish or English. Instructions such as “Show me the father in this family! Show me the grandfather in this family!” are given in Turkish and pupils can respond physically by pointing to the relevant family members without speaking.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “family and family members” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “family” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge about the concept of “family”, a very short cartoon film of a very famous and popular family known to the pupils is shown on the Smart Board before themain teaching/learning flow in the class begins.The teacher asks pupils to watch the film and they do it. When they have finished watching the film, the teacher asks them in Turkish what the film was about and wants the answer aloud in chorus as the whole class in Turkish: “… family!” The teacher asks them to think about this until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a family and pictures of family members in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “family” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

As Year 2 Primary school pupils, they can know what a family is and what its members are. It is also assumed that they know how to describe their physical traits such as the colour of their eyes or hair, in their own language, Turkish.They know some language chunks such as “This is … What colour…? as well as the basic colours (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) in English, that they learned in the previous themes, which could help them ask and answer questions about family members and their physical traits such as “My mother’s/ has got blue eyes” in this theme.As an initial start, a fun non-theme warm-up activity is done as an icebreaker to help the pupils feel positive and ready for the whole learning process in class for their well-being. This could be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to/singing a song/chant/rhyme and so on that does not require any knowledge of English and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils have the knowledge of their family members such as their father, mother, sister, brother, grandmother, and grandfather in their own language. This knowledge prepares them to identify the same concept in English as their foreign language. Besides, they could use some additional language elements such as colours (blue, green…), numbers (1-2) and basic adjectives (small, big…) to describe the physical features of family members in a simple way. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about family members and related physical descriptions using basic colours to talk about their eye colours or using adjectives such as small, big, long, and short in English. An example of an exercise might be to point correctly to family members in a picture by giving instructions in Turkish without speaking any English without letting the pupils speak Turkish or English. Instructions such as “Show me the father in this family! Show me the grandfather in this family!” are given in Turkish and pupils can respond physically by pointing to the relevant family members without speaking.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “family and family members” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “family” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge about the concept of “family”, a very short cartoon film of a very famous and popular family known to the pupils is shown on the Smart Board before themain teaching/learning flow in the class begins.The teacher asks pupils to watch the film and they do it. When they have finished watching the film, the teacher asks them in Turkish what the film was about and wants the answer aloud in chorus as the whole class in Turkish: “… family!” The teacher asks them to think about this until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a family and pictures of family members in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “family” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

As Year 2 Primary school pupils, they can know what a family is and what its members are. It is also assumed that they know how to describe their physical traits such as the colour of their eyes or hair, in their own language, Turkish.They know some language chunks such as “This is … What colour…? as well as the basic colours (black, white, pink, red, yellow, blue, and green) in English, that they learned in the previous themes, which could help them ask and answer questions about family members and their physical traits such as “My mother’s/ has got blue eyes” in this theme.As an initial start, a fun non-theme warm-up activity is done as an icebreaker to help the pupils feel positive and ready for the whole learning process in class for their well-being. This could be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to/singing a song/chant/rhyme and so on that does not require any knowledge of English and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is assumed that pupils have the knowledge of their family members such as their father, mother, sister, brother, grandmother, and grandfather in their own language. This knowledge prepares them to identify the same concept in English as their foreign language. Besides, they could use some additional language elements such as colours (blue, green…), numbers (1-2) and basic adjectives (small, big…) to describe the physical features of family members in a simple way. It is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about family members and related physical descriptions using basic colours to talk about their eye colours or using adjectives such as small, big, long, and short in English. An example of an exercise might be to point correctly to family members in a picture by giving instructions in Turkish without speaking any English without letting the pupils speak Turkish or English. Instructions such as “Show me the father in this family! Show me the grandfather in this family!” are given in Turkish and pupils can respond physically by pointing to the relevant family members without speaking.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “family and family members” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about them (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “family” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge about the concept of “family”, a very short cartoon film of a very famous and popular family known to the pupils is shown on the Smart Board before themain teaching/learning flow in the class begins.The teacher asks pupils to watch the film and they do it. When they have finished watching the film, the teacher asks them in Turkish what the film was about and wants the answer aloud in chorus as the whole class in Turkish: “… family!” The teacher asks them to think about this until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a family and pictures of family members in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils are paired up and take turns to act out the target words of the theme while their peers guess and describe the actions in detail. They repeat the words and chunks when they have finished guessing. A time limit for acting out and describing can be added to increase difficulty. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be made more challenging by using a larger set of flashcards with the vocabulary of the target theme and adding a time limit. Pupils can also create their own flashcards to include in the game. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: King’s gameThey could play the King’s Game with more flashcards with additional details, and pupils can be asked to describe the missing cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: CategorisingA list of categories or themes (e.g., different rooms in a house or pets) could be given by the teacher, but no specific words are provided. The vocabulary related to these themes/categories are selected by the pupils and written in their picture dictionaries. As well as drawing or finding pictures, the pupils should write relevant language chunks using the target words. For instance, for a target word such as “garden”, a target language chunk such as “The rabbit is in the garden” could be written. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Interactive MapA digital tool could be used by pupils to create an interactive map of a house. Pupils write target language chunks about what they have learned from this theme are written by the pupils after they have completed their maps. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 6: Digital gameTo make the learning processes of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, various digital games can be played on a Web 2.0 for differentiated learning activities. Teachers can create this digital content themselves following the coursebook or use pre-existing digital content that is aligned with the coursebook.How to play the Word Soup Game on a Web 2.0 tool?Create a word pool: First, choose words related to the theme and appropriate for the pupils’ age and level.Write these words in a mixed order to create the word soup.Prepare the game: Create a ‘Word Soup’ game via a Web 2.0 tool. Add the selected words to the game in a mixed order.Set the rules: Explain to the pupils that they have to use the mixed words to form meaningful and correct language chunks that they have learnt in the theme. Give a specific number of points for each correct language chunk. The pupil or the group that forms the most correct sentences wins the game.Play the game: Give the pupils a set amount of time. At the end of the time, check the sentences formed by each pupil or group. Give points for correct and meaningful sentences. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To consolidate and improve their knowledge and skills about the language for the vocabulary of a house, its parts and pets living in it according to their own pace in English.Activity 1: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be adapted by using a smaller set of flashcards with target vocabulary related to the house and including pictures to help with recognition. Pupils could work in pairs, with one turning over the cards and the other calling out the names, and the teacher could provide clues or gestures to help with recall. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: King’s gameKing’s Game could also be adapted with fewer flashcards to be used with extended viewing time. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Picture dictionaryThe teacher gives the pupils a list of target words and corresponding pictures. The pupils copy the words and paste or draw pictures next to each word in their picture dictionaries. A template with blank spaces for words and pictures is used to guide pupils on where to place each element. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Digital gamePupils use a digital tool with pre-defined house templates where the rooms are already outlined. Pupils drag and drop images associated with parts of the house into the correct places on the map. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Digital gameTo make the learning process of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, digital games are used for differentiated learning activities. Teachers can create this digital content themselves, following the coursebook, or use pre-existing digital content that matches the coursebook. They can play the matching game on a Web 2.0 tool, where they have to match the item displayed on the screen with its English equivalent. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.",

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

They repeat the words and chunks when they have finished guessing. A time limit for acting out and describing can be added to increase difficulty. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be made more challenging by using a larger set of flashcards with the vocabulary of the target theme and adding a time limit. Pupils can also create their own flashcards to include in the game. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: King’s gameThey could play the King’s Game with more flashcards with additional details, and pupils can be asked to describe the missing cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: CategorisingA list of categories or themes (e.g., different rooms in a house or pets) could be given by the teacher, but no specific words are provided. The vocabulary related to these themes/categories are selected by the pupils and written in their picture dictionaries. As well as drawing or finding pictures, the pupils should write relevant language chunks using the target words. For instance, for a target word such as “garden”, a target language chunk such as “The rabbit is in the garden” could be written. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Interactive MapA digital tool could be used by pupils to create an interactive map of a house. Pupils write target language chunks about what they have learned from this theme are written by the pupils after they have completed their maps. They can then present their maps to the class.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English.

Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To consolidate and improve their knowledge and skills about the language for the vocabulary of a house, its parts and pets living in it according to their own pace in English.Activity 1: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be adapted by using a smaller set of flashcards with target vocabulary related to the house and including pictures to help with recognition. Pupils could work in pairs, with one turning over the cards and the other calling out the names, and the teacher could provide clues or gestures to help with recall. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: King’s gameKing’s Game could also be adapted with fewer flashcards to be used with extended viewing time. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Picture dictionaryThe teacher gives the pupils a list of target words and corresponding pictures. The pupils copy the words and paste or draw pictures next to each word in their picture dictionaries. A template with blank spaces for words and pictures is used to guide pupils on where to place each element. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Digital gamePupils use a digital tool with pre-defined house templates where the rooms are already outlined. Pupils drag and drop images associated with parts of the house into the correct places on the map. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Digital gameTo make the learning process of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, digital games are used for differentiated learning activities. Teachers can create this digital content themselves, following the coursebook, or use pre-existing digital content that matches the coursebook. They can play the matching game on a Web 2.0 tool, where they have to match the item displayed on the screen with its English equivalent.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils are paired up and take turns to act out the target words of the theme while their peers guess and describe the actions in detail. They repeat the words and chunks when they have finished guessing. A time limit for acting out and describing can be added to increase difficulty. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be made more challenging by using a larger set of flashcards with the vocabulary of the target theme and adding a time limit. Pupils can also create their own flashcards to include in the game. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: King’s gameThey could play the King’s Game with more flashcards with additional details, and pupils can be asked to describe the missing cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: CategorisingA list of categories or themes (e.g., different rooms in a house or pets) could be given by the teacher, but no specific words are provided. The vocabulary related to these themes/categories are selected by the pupils and written in their picture dictionaries. As well as drawing or finding pictures, the pupils should write relevant language chunks using the target words. For instance, for a target word such as “garden”, a target language chunk such as “The rabbit is in the garden” could be written. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Interactive MapA digital tool could be used by pupils to create an interactive map of a house. Pupils write target language chunks about what they have learned from this theme are written by the pupils after they have completed their maps. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 6: Digital gameTo make the learning processes of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, various digital games can be played on a Web 2.0 for differentiated learning activities. Teachers can create this digital content themselves following the coursebook or use pre-existing digital content that is aligned with the coursebook.How to play the Word Soup Game on a Web 2.0 tool?Create a word pool: First, choose words related to the theme and appropriate for the pupils’ age and level.Write these words in a mixed order to create the word soup.Prepare the game: Create a ‘Word Soup’ game via a Web 2.0 tool. Add the selected words to the game in a mixed order.Set the rules: Explain to the pupils that they have to use the mixed words to form meaningful and correct language chunks that they have learnt in the theme. Give a specific number of points for each correct language chunk. The pupil or the group that forms the most correct sentences wins the game.Play the game: Give the pupils a set amount of time. At the end of the time, check the sentences formed by each pupil or group. Give points for correct and meaningful sentences. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To consolidate and improve their knowledge and skills about the language for the vocabulary of a house, its parts and pets living in it according to their own pace in English.Activity 1: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be adapted by using a smaller set of flashcards with target vocabulary related to the house and including pictures to help with recognition. Pupils could work in pairs, with one turning over the cards and the other calling out the names, and the teacher could provide clues or gestures to help with recall. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: King’s gameKing’s Game could also be adapted with fewer flashcards to be used with extended viewing time. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Picture dictionaryThe teacher gives the pupils a list of target words and corresponding pictures.

A template with blank spaces for words and pictures is used to guide pupils on where to place each element. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Digital gamePupils use a digital tool with pre-defined house templates where the rooms are already outlined. Pupils drag and drop images associated with parts of the house into the correct places on the map. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Digital gameTo make the learning process of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, digital games are used for differentiated learning activities.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

They repeat the words and chunks when they have finished guessing. A time limit for acting out and describing can be added to increase difficulty. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be made more challenging by using a larger set of flashcards with the vocabulary of the target theme and adding a time limit. Pupils can also create their own flashcards to include in the game. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: King’s gameThey could play the King’s Game with more flashcards with additional details, and pupils can be asked to describe the missing cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: CategorisingA list of categories or themes (e.g., different rooms in a house or pets) could be given by the teacher, but no specific words are provided. The vocabulary related to these themes/categories are selected by the pupils and written in their picture dictionaries. As well as drawing or finding pictures, the pupils should write relevant language chunks using the target words. For instance, for a target word such as “garden”, a target language chunk such as “The rabbit is in the garden” could be written.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Pupils are paired up and take turns to act out the target words of the theme while their peers guess and describe the actions in detail. They repeat the words and chunks when they have finished guessing. A time limit for acting out and describing can be added to increase difficulty. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be made more challenging by using a larger set of flashcards with the vocabulary of the target theme and adding a time limit. Pupils can also create their own flashcards to include in the game. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: King’s gameThey could play the King’s Game with more flashcards with additional details, and pupils can be asked to describe the missing cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: CategorisingA list of categories or themes (e.g., different rooms in a house or pets) could be given by the teacher, but no specific words are provided. The vocabulary related to these themes/categories are selected by the pupils and written in their picture dictionaries. As well as drawing or finding pictures, the pupils should write relevant language chunks using the target words. For instance, for a target word such as “garden”, a target language chunk such as “The rabbit is in the garden” could be written. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 5: Interactive MapA digital tool could be used by pupils to create an interactive map of a house. Pupils write target language chunks about what they have learned from this theme are written by the pupils after they have completed their maps. They can then present their maps to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 6: Digital gameTo make the learning processes of pupils more enjoyable for the pupils, various digital games can be played on a Web 2.0 for differentiated learning activities. Teachers can create this digital content themselves following the coursebook or use pre-existing digital content that is aligned with the coursebook.How to play the Word Soup Game on a Web 2.0 tool?Create a word pool: First, choose words related to the theme and appropriate for the pupils’ age and level.Write these words in a mixed order to create the word soup.Prepare the game: Create a ‘Word Soup’ game via a Web 2.0 tool. Add the selected words to the game in a mixed order.Set the rules: Explain to the pupils that they have to use the mixed words to form meaningful and correct language chunks that they have learnt in the theme. Give a specific number of points for each correct language chunk. The pupil or the group that forms the most correct sentences wins the game.Play the game: Give the pupils a set amount of time. At the end of the time, check the sentences formed by each pupil or group. Give points for correct and meaningful sentences. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To consolidate and improve their knowledge and skills about the language for the vocabulary of a house, its parts and pets living in it according to their own pace in English.Activity 1: PelmanismThe Pelmanism game could be adapted by using a smaller set of flashcards with target vocabulary related to the house and including pictures to help with recognition. Pupils could work in pairs, with one turning over the cards and the other calling out the names, and the teacher could provide clues or gestures to help with recall. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: King’s gameKing’s Game could also be adapted with fewer flashcards to be used with extended viewing time. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Picture dictionaryThe teacher gives the pupils a list of target words and corresponding pictures. The pupils copy the words and paste or draw pictures next to each word in their picture dictionaries. A template with blank spaces for words and pictures is used to guide pupils on where to place each element. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Digital gamePupils use a digital tool with pre-defined house templates where the rooms are already outlined. Pupils drag and drop images associated with parts of the house into the correct places on the map. They can then present their maps to the class.

This performance will be evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of homes & houses & neighbourhoods with its components such as a house and its parts, rooms, and furniture in it in their own language. As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what a house is and what we have in it. They are also expected to know that pets are animals that live with families in houses. Besides, they know how to describe the location of furniture, people, and pets (if there are any) in a house in their own language, Turkish. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English as well. It is assumed that as they have learnt how to ask what things/people are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/ this? This is a …”; “What colour…? It’s/is blue” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “home & houses & neighbourhood” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about a house and the rooms, furniture and pets that live in it as well as their numbers, locations and very simple descriptions. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…), simple adjectives (small, big etc…) and body parts (ears, noses etc…) in English which they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content about the concept of “house”.Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), body parts (ears, nose, legs, eyes), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is blue”, and “I’ve/have got a … She’s/has got a …” (since they are going to learn “We’ve/have got…” in the current theme)” by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be taken into consideration by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme.Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “house” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “house” in English. To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of a house, a short cartoon or animated story that is well known to the, with very well-known characters from a well-known cartoon is shown on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The cartoon shows a house with rooms inside. (To prepare the short cartoon or animated story, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used).The pupils are asked to watch the cartoon, and they do. When they have finished watching it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what it is in the cartoon. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not. The teacher asks them to think about it until they watch the next film, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English. An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a house and pictures of parts of the house in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “house” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn.

I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana.

These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk? Do you like milk?CUSTOMER: No, I don’t like milk.SELLER: Do you like water?CUSTOMER: Yes, I like water.SELLER: Here you are!CUSTOMER: Thank you!SELLER: Do you like apples?CUSTOMER: Red apples?SELLER: No, green apples.CUSTOMER: No! I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use.

If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”.

The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page.

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk?

I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use.

They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana. I like bananas.Low achievers (pupils) can make a video where they show foods/drinks and say whether they like it or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.",

The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures.

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path.

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk? Do you like milk?CUSTOMER: No, I don’t like milk.SELLER: Do you like water?CUSTOMER: Yes, I like water.SELLER: Here you are!CUSTOMER: Thank you!SELLER: Do you like apples?CUSTOMER: Red apples?SELLER: No, green apples.CUSTOMER: No! I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana.

People who start to learn a new language bring with them their pre-existing knowledge and transfer it to their new language learning. So, Year 2 Primary school pupils will know what food means as a concept but will not know its equivalents in another language.However, this existing knowledge in their own language will help them recognise, understand, and learn it more easily in a foreign language, English in this case.Principles Basic food items are presented as a topic where certain categories, items, and related actions function as important components.Basic food items serve as an essential context where foundational social interactions of expressing preferences, asking for items, and making polite requests are practiced naturally and authentically in EFL.Key Concepts:Items, food, basic food, basic food items, food types, meals.",

    "olcme_degerlendirme": "PERFORMANCE ASSIGNMENT: Pupils work on self-recordings (visual, audio) at school/ at home presenting an interview with a classmate/friend/family member about their preferences for food with pictures and/or realia. The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk? Do you like milk?CUSTOMER: No, I don’t like milk.SELLER: Do you like water?CUSTOMER: Yes, I like water.SELLER: Here you are!CUSTOMER: Thank you!SELLER: Do you like apples?CUSTOMER: Red apples?SELLER: No, green apples.CUSTOMER: No! I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana. I like bananas.Low achievers (pupils) can make a video where they show foods/drinks and say whether they like it or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.",

The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk? Do you like milk?CUSTOMER: No, I don’t like milk.SELLER: Do you like water?CUSTOMER: Yes, I like water.SELLER: Here you are!CUSTOMER: Thank you!SELLER: Do you like apples?CUSTOMER: Red apples?SELLER: No, green apples.CUSTOMER: No! I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana.

The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, they draw a food card, and use the vocabulary in a sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some beans”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions like “I’m hungry!” or “It’s delicious!” are used when a card with these language chunks are drawn. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 3: Drama – Role PlayA market stall is set up by pupils. Pupils work in pairs. One pupil from the expansion group can be the seller and the other pupils can be the customer. They can have a dialogue like the one given below.CUSTOMER: Hello!SELLER: Hi, welcome!CUSTOMER: What is your name?SELLER: My name is ……CUSTOMER: I am ……. I am thirsty.SELLER: Milk? Do you like milk?CUSTOMER: No, I don’t like milk.SELLER: Do you like water?CUSTOMER: Yes, I like water.SELLER: Here you are!CUSTOMER: Thank you!SELLER: Do you like apples?CUSTOMER: Red apples?SELLER: No, green apples.CUSTOMER: No! I don’t like green apples.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 4: Introducing yourselfPupils are asked to prepare a video. In this video, one of the animals they have previously learnt about will be the main character. They can use a toy or a picture of the animal they have chosen. They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table.

They can introduce the animal by animating it (to introduce itself) talking about its colour and body parts. Immediately afterward, they should also show and introduce food/drink in the video and say whether the animal likes them or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.SupportingObjective: To help pupils talk about food, basic food items, and their preferences for food in English by using target vocabulary.Activity 1: Foodie Adventure GameThe game board is simplified with fewer spaces and the focus is placed on basic language use. Turns are made by rolling the cube and moving tokens along the path. If they land on a space with a food symbol, a food item card is drawn, and the vocabulary is used in a simple sentence, e.g., “I’ve got some milk”. When landing on a space with a preference symbol, a preference card is drawn, and the question is answered with a simple response, e.g., “Do you like chicken?” with “Yes, I do” or “No, I don’t”. Social language expressions such as “Yummy!” or “I’m thirsty!” are used when prompted by the cards. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: MatchingPupils are told that there will be an activity related to the food they learnt in the theme and they are asked to bring food or drink (milk etc.) from home that matches the words they have learnt. A table is placed in front of the board. Each pupil stands up and introduces the food/drink they have brought and says whether they like it or not. Then they put the food or drink on the table. At the end of the activity, a market stall will have been created.e.g.: This is a banana. I like bananas.Low achievers (pupils) can make a video where they show foods/drinks and say whether they like it or not.Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.",

The assignment is evaluated using rubrics.LEARNING-TEACHING EXPERIENCESBasic Acceptations: Preparedness/ ReadinessThis theme is based on the pupils’ knowledge of the food and preferences related to it in their own language.As the pupils are 7 years old, they can know what food is and what preferences for it mean. They are also expected to understand other people’s and their own preferences for food and to be able to express them in their own language. This knowledge would prepare them to identify the same concepts in their foreign language, English. as well. It is assumed that they will have learnt how to ask what things are and how to introduce them using language chunks such as “What’s/is it/this? This is a ….”; and also their colours “What colour…? It’s/is red” in English from the previous themes. These chunks can be used as a basis for learning the new language chunks in the current theme making the new chunks easier to learn.In the classroom, a fun warm-up activity which is not related to the theme “basic food items” can be conducted as an ice-breaking session to help learners be ready for the whole learning process in the class with positive feelings for their well-being. This can be an activity such as a short game, a physical activity, listening to a song/chant/rhyme and so on which will not require any English knowledge and also there will not be a need to speak Turkish.Pre-Evaluation ProcessIt is expected that pupils’ physical, cognitive, affective, and social factors are appropriate and suitable for learning about the food as well as other people’s and their own food preferences. Recalling and practising with basic colours (white, black etc…) and simple adjectives (small, big etc…) in English that they have learnt in the previous themes would be helpful as a basis for moving on and learning the current content on the concept of “food”. Therefore, a dialogue game can be played to revise colours, simple adjectives for physical descriptions (small, big, short, long), and language chunks such as “What’s/is it? This is a…” “What colour is it? It’s/is red”, and “I’ve/have got … She’s/has got …They’ve/have got …” With the vocabulary from the previous  themes by giving instructions in English as a preparation practice. In this way, their performance can be  evaluated by seeing how much they remember and how much they are able to understand and use previously learnt vocabulary and chunks to build their competence in the current theme. It can be decided what to emphasise or practise in order to revise the previous knowledge and to facilitate the new vocabulary and chunks in the current theme. (Their performance can be evaluated by rubrics.)Establishing LinksPupils are asked to recall the concept of “food” by remembering their pre-existing background knowledge about it (imaginatively through thinking) in their own language to make links with the current activities in the theme in English without translating anything until they start learning the target words in the current (new) concept, “food” in English.To remind them of the pre-existing background knowledge they already have about the concept of “food”, a short animated scene can be prepared and shown (it can be a paper picture format if there are technological problems) on the blackboard/Smart Board before the main teaching/learning flow of the class begins. The animated scene shows a fridge with food inside (To prepare the animated page, some Web 2.0 programmes can be used). The pupils are asked to look at the animated page. When they have finished looking at it, the teacher asks them in Turkish if they have understood what was on the page. She/He wants them to nod yes or to indicate whether they understood what it was about or not.The teacher asks them to think about it until they see the next visual, which is the main entry material of the theme, the digital entry story, without asking any further questions in Turkish or English.An example practice could be done to point correctly to a picture of a basket and pictures of basic food types, items, and meals in it correctly when they are given instructions by the teacher with English, Turkish and/or with mimics and gestures. Pupils give responses by pointing out relevant so-called pictures without speaking any English and/or Turkish.In this way, connections are made between pre-existing knowledge about school (in their minds) in their own language and the present information about the concept of “food” through meaningful contextualised activities with visuals within the theme.",

Different food items and drinks are written down, using the vocabulary and language chunks that have been learnt. The menus are then presented to the class. Pupils reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity by using emoticons.Activity 2: Foodie Adventure GameThe teacher creates a large poster or a printable game board with a winding path. Food cards with pictures and names (water, milk, bread, chicken, fish, eggs, tomatoes, bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, beans) and preference cards with language chunks like “Do you like [food item]?” and “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.” are provided. The game board is designed with a start and finish, and a winding path with spaces is drawn by the teacher. Food cards and preference cards are placed in separate piles. Spaces on the board are marked where players must draw a card from the food or preference pile. Players take turns rolling the cube and moving their token along the path.
