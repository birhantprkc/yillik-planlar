The teacher prepares 4- 5 Challenge Cards for each square. The class is divided into 4-5 teams, and teams take turns to move across the board, completing challenges at different squares. In the beginning, the teacher asks a different question to each team, randomly, who pick a card and each card has a number of steps to move forward, e.g. 3 steps forward. The aim is to collect 3 “Achievement Badges” and reach the “Finish Line” first. When a team lands on a school location, the teacher presents a “Challenge Card” specific to that location, which also has a number of steps, so each team knows how many steps they should take. The team must complete the challenge by using the appropriate vocabulary and grammar, e.g. “Talk about how many books your team has read this term”. The team that successfully answers the challenges collects “Achievement Badges” and advances on the board. The teacher may also add “Surprise Challenges” along the path to add excitement and encouragement for teamwork. The winning team earns a “School Adventure Champion” badge. The teacher provides constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and adequate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they did well and one thing they want to improve for next time.

The teacher prepares 4- 5 Challenge Cards for each square. The class is divided into 4-5 teams, and teams take turns to move across the board, completing challenges at different squares. In the beginning, the teacher asks a different question to each team, randomly, who pick a card and each card has a number of steps to move forward, e.g. 3 steps forward. The aim is to collect 3 “Achievement Badges” and reach the “Finish Line” first. When a team lands on a school location, the teacher presents a “Challenge Card” specific to that location, which also has a number of steps, so each team knows how many steps they should take. The team must complete the challenge by using the appropriate vocabulary and grammar, e.g. “Talk about how many books your team has read this term”. The team that successfully answers the challenges collects “Achievement Badges” and advances on the board. The teacher may also add “Surprise Challenges” along the path to add excitement and encouragement for teamwork. The winning team earns a “School Adventure Champion” badge. The teacher provides constructive feedback on students’ performances in terms of accurate and adequate use of target vocabulary and grammar and their presentation. Students write down one thing they did well and one thing they want to improve for next time. They also give a ‘stars’ rating (1-5) for their peer’s performance, followed by a short explanation: “I gave you 4 stars because your pronunciation is good, but you should give more details”.

Example prompts include: “If you were able to travel to the past, where would you go?”, “If you were able to meet anyone from the past, who would it be?” or “If you were a famous figure from history, what advice would you give people today?”. One student asks questions, and the other responds by using the Second Conditional sentences. The teacher encourages students to ask follow-up questions based on what their peer says. This helps them practise more complex sentence structures and keeps the conversation flowing. Example follow- up questions: “Why would you choose to meet them?” or “What would you do if you could live in their time?”. Students change roles after a few minutes, so they experience both asking and answering questions. After the role-play, the teacher asks a few pairs to share their sentences and time travel scenarios with the class and writes some of the more interesting or funny responses on the board.

    "farklilaştirma": "ExpansionObjective: To talk about hypothetical scenarios in English by using the target vocabulary and    the grammar.Activity 1: Time Traveller’s DilemmaThe teacher divides students into pairs and gives each pair a scenario card with a challenging, creative time travel prompt such as “You are a time traveller from 2500. You meet Cleopatra in ancient Egypt and can only talk to her for 10 minutes. What would you say?” or “You are an astronaut who travels back to the year 2025. How would you explain your mission?”. The teacher allows pairs to choose one card, which determines their roles. In their pairs, students create a short role-play around the scenario on their cards. They are supposed to use Second Conditional sentences in their conversation. Each student takes a turn acting out a role. After the role-plays, each pair shares some of the most interesting or creative scenarios with the class. The teacher writes down the more creative or complex ones on the board and praises the students for their creativity. She/ He encourages them to use more advanced conditional sentences in future activities. The students reflect on their thoughts and feelings about the activity.SupportingObjective: To talk about hypothetical scenarios by using the target vocabulary and grammar.Activity 1: Time Traveller’s DilemmaThe teacher divides the class into pairs and gives each pair a scenario card with a time travel prompt. These scenarios are engaging but simple to help students feel comfortable using second conditional sentences. Example prompts include: “If you were able to travel to the past, where would you go?”, “If you were able to meet anyone from the past, who would it be?” or “If you were a famous figure from history, what advice would you give people today?”. One student asks questions, and the other responds by using the Second Conditional sentences. The teacher encourages students to ask follow-up questions based on what their peer says. This helps them practise more complex sentence structures and keeps the conversation flowing. Example follow- up questions: “Why would you choose to meet them?” or “What would you do if you could live in their time?”. Students change roles after a few minutes, so they experience both asking and answering questions. After the role-play, the teacher asks a few pairs to share their sentences and time travel scenarios with the class and writes some of the more interesting or funny responses on the board. She/He highlights and corrects any mistakes related to the use and usage of the target grammar and praises the students for their creativity, and then encourages them to try more complex conditional sentences in future lessons.
